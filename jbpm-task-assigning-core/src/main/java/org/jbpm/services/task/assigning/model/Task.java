/**
 * Task is the only planning entity that will be changed during the problem solving, and we have only one
 * PlanningVariable.
 * <p>
 * In this particular problem we want to do the assignments in a way that the list of tasks
 * for a given user is ordered. (see e.g. that Higher priority tasks must be resolved first is a soft constraint)
 * <p>
 * User1: A <- B <- C <- D
 * <p>
 * User2: E <- F
 * <p>
 * The initial task of each sequence really points to the user that will own all the tasks in the list, so when a
 * solution is created we'll really have something like this.
 * <p>
 * User1 <- A <- B <- C <- D  (In this example we say that User1 the anchor)
 * <p>
 * This explains why property "previousTaskOrUser" can be assigned with User or a Task.
 * <p>
 * BUT the solver will build the solutions in a way that only the first item of the "chain" will point to
 * a user. This is how a CHAINED configuration works. And the way the solver knows which must be the fact class
 * that must be used for setting the previousTaskOrUser property is by considering the order in the PlanningVariable
 * configuration.
 * @PlanningVariable(valueRangeProviderRefs = {"userRange", "taskRange"}, graphType = PlanningVariableGraphType.CHAINED)
 * <p>
 * Here we basically declared that we want to build a CHAINED graph but also since the "userRange" is the first
 * valueRangeProviderRef we are declaring that the User will be used as anchor.
 * So the solver will always start by using an User as the head of the list and then it'll consider adding Tasks
 * to the linked structure.
 * <p>
 * Additionally for the calculation of the scores, etc, given a Task of a particular solution we'll want to know quickly
 * which is the User that was assigned to this task.
 * <p>
 * If we have the following chain
 * <p>
 * Employee1 (the anchor) <- A <- B <- C <- D
 * <p>
 * and we take e.g. D, then to get the assigned Employee1 the list must be iterated, but this probably not the best idea.
 * <p>
 * Solution, add a shadow variable and let the solver populate this variable when the solution is constructed.
 * With the declaration below a shadow variable is defined for keeping a reference to the anchor. This shadow variable
 * is populated and kept consistent by the solver.
 * <p>
 * Shadow variable:
 * Let all Tasks have a reference to the anchor of the chain, the assigned user.
 * @AnchorShadowVariable(sourceVariableName = "previousTaskOrUser")
 * private User user;
 * <p>
 * CustomShadowVariable startTime:
 * Additionally is a convenient shadow variable is declared for having the startTime of a task already calculated.
 * @CustomShadowVariable(variableListenerClass = StartTimeUpdatingVariableListener.class,
 * // Arguable, to adhere to API specs (although this works), nextTask and user should also be a source,
 * // because this shadow must be triggered after nextTask and user (but there is no need to be triggered by those)
 * sources = {@PlanningVariableReference(variableName = "previousTaskOrUser")})
 * private Integer startTime;
 * <p>
 * So the variableListenerClass is invoked when the source variable is changed/assigned.
