/**
 * Implements the "direct" assignment of an existing Task to a User.
 * This PFC can be useful in scenarios were e.g. a system administrator manually assigns a Task to a given user from the
 * jBPM tasks list administration. While it's expected that environments that relied the tasks assigning to OptaPlanner
 * shouldn't do this "direct" assignments, we still provide this PFC for dealing with this edge case scenarios.
 * Note that this use cases might break hard constraints or introduce considerable score penalization for soft
 * constraints.
 * Additionally since the "direct" assignment comes from an "external" system it'll remain pinned.
 * <p>
 * Both the task and user to work with are looked up by using their corresponding id's. If the task is not found it'll
 * be created and added to the working solution, while if the user is not found and exception will be thrown.
